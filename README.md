## General Information
- This project analyzes Consumer Finance Company Loan Data
- This is case study for EDA module of upGrad and IIITB Machine Learning & AI Program - February 2024 batch
- The intent of this analysis is to help the company understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of  default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- The dataset used for analysis is in this github repo with name loan.csv

## Conclusions
- Reduce loans with 60-month tenure as they have higer default rate than 36-month tenure loans
- Diversify purposes for which loans are given as most of loans given are for debt consolidation and this purpose has high default rate
- Improve verification process as most of defaulters are verified customers
- Avoid loans to borrowers with public records and public bankruptcy records and delinquency history as these are almost certain to default
